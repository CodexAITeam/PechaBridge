## Font Usage for Chinese Numbers (Under Development)

For rendering Chinese number words (e.g., 一, 二, 三...), the project intends to use the **KaiTi (楷体)** font family. This font provides a style that resembles standard handwritten characters, which may be suitable for certain training data requirements.

*   **Font Information:** You can find details about the KaiTi font family on the Microsoft Typography page:
    [Microsoft Typography - KaiTi](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/kaiti)

*   **Current Status:** **Please note that the implementation within the Python scripts to specifically load and utilize the KaiTi font for drawing Chinese numbers (e.g., for Class ID 2) is still under active development.**
